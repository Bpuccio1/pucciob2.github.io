<li>My name is Brooke Alexa Puccio and I am 20 years old. I am a junior at Montclair State University and my major is biology. I love animals and aspire to become a Veterinarian after college. I have worked at Kathy Santo Dog Training in Waldwick NJ for four years. I also am a Veterinary Technician at Bergen County Veterinary Center in Waldwick NJ. I love both my jobs and I love working around animals. When I graduate in 2025 I am going to apply to Vet schools in the spring of 2025 and work at my Vet practice for a whole year. Hopefully when I get into a Vet school then I will take on Veterinary Medicine for 3-4 years to become a Veterinarian.  </li>
<li>My first hobby is that I love to sing. I love singing, I love broadway music, and I do love to perform. In High shool I was in our theater productions for three years. I have always loved to sing and theater really made me find my passion. I love going to see Broadway shows in New York, I have seen around 10 and I hope to see more shows in the future. </li>
<li>I also love to shop, I love to go to the mall with friends and buy clothes. I also love buying gifts for other people. I am totally a big gift giver and I love buying things that my friends and family will love. </li>
<li>I love to watch movies as well. My favorite movie genre is Romantic Comedies. My favorite movie of all time is "13 Going on 30" with Jennifer Garner and Mark Rufalo. My favorite actress is Jennifer Garner and my favorite actor is Timothee Chalamet. I have a whole movie list on phone with about 100 movies that I absolutely love. That list mostly contains romantic comedies which include, "When Harry Met Sally", "10 Things I Hate About You",etc. I also love Marvel movies. I am a huge Marvel fan, my favorite characters have to Captain America, Bucky Barnes, and Wanda Maximoff. My favorite Marvel Movie has to be "Captain America: Civil War" and the television series "Wandavision"  </li>

<td>Volunteering: In 2017 I raised money for the Ramapo-Bergen Animal Refuge. I also used to volunteer as a camp counselor at many different bible camps during the summertime when I was in middle school. My sophomore year of high school I volunteered at Camp Acorn where I worked with children and adults with disabilities and we all went to an Aquarium in Connecticut. In elementary school I would volunteer with a group of girls and sing to the elderly during Christmas time. We would sing, eat food, and hang out with the elderly. 3 months ago I also volunteered at Bergen County Veterinary Center for a spay and neuter event with "Real Dog Rescue." I got to help monitor the surgeries and help with before and after care of the surgeries. Working hands on in a Veterinary practice was super fun and helpful.   </td>
<td>Career Goals: As mentioned before I hope to become a Veterinarian. As of right now I work as a veterinary technician and I love working in rooms with Doctors. I also love building connections with the animals and their owners.  </td>

<td>Favorites: My favorite television show is "The Office". I love the color pink, my favorite animal is a kangaroo. I love gold jewelry and I love dressing up.
